## Phase 5 Session Prompt

### Session 5.1: Documentation & Production Polish

# FEATURE DEVELOPMENT SESSION

## Feature Overview

Create comprehensive documentation, example usage patterns, and prepare the Astral MCP server for broader distribution and production usage.

## User Story Context

As a developer or operator, I want to verify the server works as intended and easily understand how to install, configure, and integrate it so I can successfully deploy and use the location attestation querying capabilities in my AI workflows.

## Technical Scope

- **Modify/create:** Complete `README.md`, API documentation, troubleshooting guides, and example configurations
- **Integrate with:** MCP Inspector final validation, multiple host applications for integration examples
- **Data requirements:** Example queries, sample responses, configuration templates, and troubleshooting scenarios
- **UI/UX requirements:** Clear, beginner-friendly documentation with step-by-step guides

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Comprehensive README Creation:** Write complete installation, setup, and usage documentation with clear sections
2. **API Reference Documentation:** Document all tools with parameter details, response formats, and practical examples
3. **Integration Example Creation:** Provide working examples for Claude Desktop, VS Code, and Cursor with real configuration files
4. **Troubleshooting Guide Development:** Create problem resolution documentation for common integration and usage issues
5. **Production Readiness Assessment:** Add basic logging, monitoring considerations, and deployment best practices

## Dependencies

- Completed and tested MCP server from all previous phases
- Functional integration with at least Claude Desktop from Phase 4
- All tools validated via MCP Inspector testing from Phase 3
- Working Poetry environment and proper project structure

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Documentation must enable new users to set up and use the server within 15 minutes
- **Completeness:** All tools must be documented with examples and common usage patterns
- **Maintainability:** Documentation structure should support easy updates and extensions
- **Accessibility:** Instructions must work across Windows, Mac, and Linux environments

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Complete README.md with installation, configuration, usage, and integration sections
- [ ] API reference documentation includes all tools with parameter details and examples
- [ ] Working integration examples provided for Claude Desktop and VS Code with actual configuration files
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide covers common setup and usage issues with step-by-step solutions
- [ ] Example query patterns document real-world usage scenarios with expected outputs
- [ ] Basic production considerations documented (logging, monitoring, error handling)

## Open Questions

- Should the documentation include advanced usage patterns like custom query workflows or just focus on basic functionality?
- What level of troubleshooting detail is appropriate - basic setup issues or advanced debugging techniques?
- Should we include performance optimization guidance or keep it focused on functional usage?
- Do you want example query results included in the documentation, or just the query patterns?

**Any specific documentation requirements or particular audience considerations before we finalize the complete project?**
