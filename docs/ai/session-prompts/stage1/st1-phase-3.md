## Phase 3 Session Prompt

### Session 3.1: Comprehensive Testing & Debug Resolution

# FEATURE DEVELOPMENT SESSION

## Feature Overview

Validate and debug the complete MCP server implementation using MCP Inspector and ensure all tools function correctly with proper protocol compliance.

## User Story Context

As a developer, I want to thoroughly test the MCP server using official development tools so I can identify and resolve any protocol-level issues before real-world integration, ensuring reliable performance for end users.

## Technical Scope

- **Modify/create:** Test scripts and debugging configurations in the project
- **Integrate with:** MCP Inspector tool for comprehensive protocol testing
- **Data requirements:** Test scenarios covering success cases, edge cases, and error conditions
- **UI/UX requirements:** Clear test output and debugging information

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MCP Inspector Setup:** Configure and run comprehensive testing using `poetry run mcp dev astral_mcp_server/server.py`
2. **Tool Validation:** Test all three tools (health_check, query_location_proofs, get_location_proof_by_uid, get_astral_config) with various parameter combinations
3. **Error Scenario Testing:** Validate error handling for network timeouts, invalid inputs, and API failures
4. **Performance Validation:** Ensure response times meet sub-2 second requirements for typical queries
5. **Protocol Compliance:** Verify all MCP protocol requirements are met with proper tool metadata and responses

## Dependencies

- Completed MCP server implementation from Phase 2
- Working Poetry environment with all dependencies installed
- Access to Astral API endpoints for live testing
- MCP Inspector tool available via `mcp` CLI

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** All tools must respond within 2 seconds for standard queries
- **Reliability:** Error handling must gracefully manage all failure scenarios without crashing
- **Protocol Compliance:** Full adherence to MCP specification for tool definitions and responses
- **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging must be available for troubleshooting

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tools pass functional tests via MCP Inspector without errors
- [ ] Performance validation confirms sub-2 second response times for typical queries
- [ ] Error handling scenarios work correctly (timeouts, invalid inputs, API failures)
- [ ] Debug logging is properly configured and provides useful information
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance is verified with proper tool metadata and response formats
- [ ] Test documentation covers all scenarios and expected outcomes

## Open Questions

- Should we implement automated testing scripts alongside manual MCP Inspector testing?
- What level of performance monitoring do you want during testing (detailed timing, memory usage)?
- Should we test with mock API responses to validate error handling without depending on live API?

**What specific testing scenarios or edge cases are you most concerned about validating?**
