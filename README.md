# astral-api-mcp

A basic MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI models to query attestations from the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) using the available Astral GraphQL endpoints and APIs.

## Project Overview

We are exploring the development of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent that integrates with the [Astral API](https://docs.astral.global/getting-started) to enable intelligent querying and analysis of attestations submitted to the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS). This agent would support complex queries across spatial and temporal dimensions, such as filtering attestations by schema ID, location, or date range, while maintaining persistent context across sessions. By leveraging Astral’s structured API and EAS’s open schema model, the agent could automate common analytical workflows—like generating attestation heatmaps or tracking schema usage over time—making it a valuable tool for both research and production use cases. This early scoping phase would help assess feasibility and determine if this direction merits further investment.
